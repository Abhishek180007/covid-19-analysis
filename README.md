# covid-19-analysis
As pandemic COVID -19 has affected the world, its my work to make an analysis ,visualisation and prediction of its spread and effects in world and India.
Here I have used jupyter notebook as a working platform.
Language: Python.
I have used tensorflow and keras for DNN ,matplotlib for visualisation of data and pandas,numpy for retrieving and manipulating the data.
